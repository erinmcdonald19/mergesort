# mergesort
Erin McDonald& Michael Franklin


Okay so I got serial sorting, thread creation, command line args, and global variables working
also, made a make file so now just use make. (if you don't use make, include the -pthread flag on the gcc)

So if you can look at his vector sum and get each thread to identify which piece it needs to work on, that would be dope. 

please leave detailed comments so I know whatsup when I come back to it :)
